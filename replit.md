- **API Design**: RESTful endpoints with JSON responses.
- **Real-time Communication**: WebSocket and WebRTC for video consultations.
- **Security**: Advanced login security with Base64 encryption, IP tracking, rate limiting, secure session management, and robust error handling. Full LGPD compliance with consent management, audit logging, and data export tools.

### Database Architecture
- **Primary Database**: PostgreSQL (configured via Drizzle ORM).
- **ORM**: Drizzle for type-safe database operations.
- **Session Storage**: PostgreSQL-backed session store for authentication.
- **Schema**: Comprehensive medical data models including users, patients, doctors, appointments, prescriptions, and medical records.

### Development & Deployment
- **Environments**: Optimized for Replit development with hot reload and multi-platform production deployment (Render, Heroku, Vercel).
- **CI/CD**: Automated CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions for build, test, and deploy, including automated backups and rollbacks.
- **Monitoring**: Integrated with UptimeRobot, StatusCake, and Slack/Telegram notifications for comprehensive health and performance monitoring.
