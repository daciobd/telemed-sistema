- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for responsive design.
- **State Management**: React Query for server state management.
- **Routing**: React Router for client-side navigation (or Next.js App Router).
- **Design Principles**: Duotone color scheme (#A7C7E7, #F4D9B4, #E9967A), professional gradients, subtle micro-animations (fade-in, scale, bounce), consistent border-radius (20px), mobile-first approach.
- **Key Features**: Professional login and registration flows, patient and doctor dashboards, medical specialty pages, appointment scheduling, bidding system for consultations, AI-powered psychiatric triage, notification center, and comprehensive medical profile management.
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 conformity with ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, and screen reader support.
- **Performance**: Optimized images (WebP), lazy loading, CSS variables, and GPU-accelerated animations.

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js framework.
- **Language**: TypeScript for type safety.

- **API Design**: RESTful endpoints with JSON responses.
- **Real-time Communication**: WebSocket and WebRTC for video consultations.
- **Security**: Advanced login security with Base64 encryption, IP tracking, rate limiting, secure session management, and robust error handling. Full LGPD compliance with consent management, audit logging, and data export tools.

### Database Architecture
- **Primary Database**: PostgreSQL (configured via Drizzle ORM).
- **ORM**: Drizzle for type-safe database operations.
- **Session Storage**: PostgreSQL-backed session store for authentication.
- **Schema**: Comprehensive medical data models including users, patients, doctors, appointments, prescriptions, and medical records.

### Development & Deployment
- **Environments**: Optimized for Replit development with hot reload and multi-platform production deployment (Render, Heroku, Vercel).
- **CI/CD**: Automated CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions for build, test, and deploy, including automated backups and rollbacks.
- **Monitoring**: Integrated with UptimeRobot, StatusCake, and Slack/Telegram notifications for comprehensive health and performance monitoring.
