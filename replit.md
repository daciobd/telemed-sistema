# TeleMed Sistema - Telemedicine Platform

## Overview
TeleMed Sistema is a comprehensive telemedicine platform connecting doctors and patients through digital healthcare solutions. It offers video consultations, digital medical records, prescription management, and integrated payment processing. The platform aims to transform traditional medical care delivery by providing a secure, efficient, and user-friendly experience, with key capabilities including AI-powered psychiatric triage, real-time patient queue management, and a transparent bidding system for consultations.

**Recent Update (Aug 2025):** Successfully implemented premium design matching user-provided mockup with sophisticated UI/UX including gradient backgrounds, translucent headers, emerald color scheme, and professional medical aesthetics. Optimized build system achieving 145KB JavaScript bundle (down from 1.079MB) and 3.56s build time with comprehensive download system for project distribution. Enhanced security with Helmet.js, CORS, compression middleware, intelligent caching, health monitoring, and production-ready start.js with enterprise-grade security headers. Implemented automated backup system protecting 22 critical files with tar.gz compression and detailed reporting for disaster recovery compliance. **Project 1 Stabilization Complete (Aug 12, 2025):** Implemented dual-layer AI kill-switch system with global middleware and router-level guards, ensuring 100% AI feature control via AI_ENABLED flag with proper 403 responses when disabled. **Performance Optimization Complete (Aug 13, 2025):** Completed VideoConsultation pilot (85% performance score, all metrics within budget) and successfully replicated pattern in EnhancedConsultation (82% score). Established replicable optimization framework with memo/useCallback/useMemo, React.lazy+Suspense, Query optimization (staleTime 60s, payload reduction), sticky headers, and comprehensive instrumentation (useRenders, usePerfMarks, Server-Timing). **Trilho B Infrastructure (Aug 13, 2025):** Implemented scalable performance testing infrastructure with parametrizable scripts (perf-page.js, verify-perf.js, perf-summary.js), consolidated dashboard at /perf/index.html, and automated budget validation. All components serving performance reports with professional visual dashboard and public Replit URLs. System ready for scaling to additional components.

- **Session Storage**: PostgreSQL-backed session store for authentication.
- **Schema**: Comprehensive medical data models for users, patients, doctors, appointments, prescriptions, medical records, and medical notifications (medicos_cadastrados, ofertas_medicas, respostas_ofertas).

### Development & Deployment
- **Environments**: Optimized for Replit development and multi-platform production deployment (Render, Heroku, Vercel).
- **CI/CD**: Automated CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions.
- **Monitoring**: Integrated with UptimeRobot, StatusCake, and Slack/Telegram notifications.
