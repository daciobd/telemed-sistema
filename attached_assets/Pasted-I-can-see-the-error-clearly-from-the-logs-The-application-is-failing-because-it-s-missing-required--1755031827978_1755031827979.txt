I can see the error clearly from the logs. The application is failing because it's missing required environment variables JWT_SECRET and COOKIE_SECRET. Let me examine the project structure and configuration files to understand how the environment variables are set up.

Opened server directory

Opened replit.md
Now let me examine the environment configuration file to see how it's set up and identify the missing variables:


Opened server/config/env.ts

Opened .env
I can see the issue clearly now. The application is expecting JWT_SECRET and COOKIE_SECRET environment variables, but they're missing from the .env file. I can also see that there's a typo - the env.ts file expects COOKIE_SECRET but also has SESSION_SECRET, which might be confusing.

Let me check if there are other environment files and then add the missing required environment variables:


Opened .env.example

Executed find . -name "*.env*" -type f
Perfect! I can see that the .env.example file has all the required environment variables, including JWT_SECRET and COOKIE_SECRET that are missing from the current .env file. Let me add these missing required environment variables to the .env file so the application can start successfully.

I understand. I can't edit the .env file directly since it contains secrets. Let me check what secrets are missing and ask the user to provide them through the proper secure method.

I can see that the database URL exists, but JWT_SECRET and COOKIE_SECRET are missing. These are required security keys for the application to run. Let me ask the user to provide these secrets.

To secure your telemedicine application, I need two security keys that protect user authentication and session data.

JWT_SECRET: This key signs and verifies user authentication tokens (must be at least 32 characters long)
COOKIE_SECRET: This key encrypts session cookies to protect user sessions (must be at least 16 characters long)

These are security credentials that protect your users' data. You can use any secure random strings for these values - they just need to be long enough for security. For example:

JWT_SECRET: "your-secure-random-string-at-least-32-chars-long"
COOKIE_SECRET: "your-cookie-secret-16-chars"
Please provide these two secrets so your app can start securely.
