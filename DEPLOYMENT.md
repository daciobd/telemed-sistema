# TeleMed Platform - Deployment Guide

## âœ… Problem Solved

The deployment error has been fixed! Your platform now has all the required scripts for deployment:

- âœ… **Build script** - `npm run build` 
- âœ… **Start script** - `npm run start`
- âœ… **Development script** - `npm run dev`

## ðŸš€ How to Deploy

### Option 1: Automatic Deployment (Recommended)

Your project now includes platform-specific configuration files that will handle deployment automatically:

- **Heroku**: Uses `Procfile`
- **Render**: Uses `render.yaml` 
- **Railway**: Uses `railway.json`
- **Vercel**: Uses `vercel.json`

### Option 2: Manual Deployment

If your platform requires manual configuration, use these commands:

```bash
# Build Command
npm run build

# Start Command  
npm run start
```

## ðŸ“‹ What Was Fixed

### 1. Deployment Package Configuration
- Created `package.deployment.json` with required build and start scripts
- Added `prepare-deployment.js` to activate deployment configuration

### 2. Build System
- `build.js` - Builds both frontend (React/Vite) and backend (Node.js/Express)
- Creates optimized production bundle in `dist/` folder
- Copies all necessary files for production

### 3. Start System
- `start.js` - Starts the production server
- Handles graceful shutdown and error recovery
- Uses `tsx` for TypeScript execution in production

### 4. Platform Configurations
- **Procfile** (Heroku): `web: node prepare-deployment.js && npm run build && npm run start`
- **render.yaml** (Render): Includes build and start commands
- **railway.json** (Railway): Configured for Node.js deployment
- **vercel.json** (Vercel): Serverless configuration

## ðŸ”§ Technical Details

### Build Process
1. Cleans previous build artifacts
2. Builds React frontend using Vite â†’ `dist/public/`
3. Copies TypeScript server files â†’ `dist/server/`
4. Copies shared utilities â†’ `dist/shared/`
5. Creates production-optimized `package.json`

### Production Dependencies
The deployment includes all necessary dependencies:
- Express server framework
- Database connectivity (PostgreSQL)
- Authentication systems
- React frontend
- TypeScript runtime support

### Environment Variables
Make sure these are configured in your deployment platform:
- `NODE_ENV=production`
- `DATABASE_URL` (for PostgreSQL)
- Any API keys your application needs

## ðŸ§ª Testing Deployment Locally

You can test the deployment process locally:

```bash
# Prepare deployment configuration
node prepare-deployment.js

# Build the application
npm run build

# Start in production mode
npm run start
```

## ðŸ“± Application Features

Your TeleMed platform includes:
- Secure patient and doctor authentication
- Video consultation capabilities
- Real-time messaging
- Patient dashboard
- Doctor dashboard
- Multilingual support (Portuguese/English)
- PostgreSQL database integration

## ðŸ”’ Security Features

- Encrypted credential processing
- Session management
- Protected medical areas
- Secure login processing
- Audit logging

The deployment is now ready for any major cloud platform!
