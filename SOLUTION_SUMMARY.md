# TeleMed Application Debug and Fix Summary

## Issue Identified
The workflow "Start application" was failing with error: `npm error Missing script: "dev"`

## Root Cause
- The package.json file only contained a "start" script that runs `node server.js`
- The workflow was configured to run `npm run dev` which didn't exist
- The project has a modern full-stack TypeScript architecture that wasn't properly configured

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Dependencies Installation
Installed all required dependencies for the full-stack application:
- Core: `vite`, `typescript`, `@vitejs/plugin-react`, `tsx`, `concurrently`, `nodemon`
- Replit plugins: `@replit/vite-plugin-runtime-error-modal`, `@replit/vite-plugin-cartographer`
- Backend: `express`, `axios`, `helmet`, `cors`, `compression`, `cookie-parser`
- Frontend: `react`, `react-dom`, `@types/react`, `@types/react-dom`
- Database: `drizzle-orm`, `drizzle-kit`, `pg`, `@types/pg`
- UI: `@radix-ui/react-slot`, `tailwind-merge`, `lucide-react`
- Forms: `react-hook-form`, `@hookform/resolvers`, `zod`
- State: `@tanstack/react-query`
- Routing: `wouter`

### 2. Development Environment Setup
Created a unified development server (`start-dev.js`) that:
- Runs the Express backend on port 5000
- Starts the Vite frontend dev server on port 5173
- Provides proper logging and health checks
- Handles graceful shutdown

### 3. TypeScript Configuration
Fixed module resolution issues by updating tsconfig.json:
- Changed `moduleResolution` from "node" to "bundler"
- Resolved LSP diagnostics for Vite plugins

### 4. Application Status
✅ **WORKING**: Backend server running on http://localhost:5000
✅ **WORKING**: Frontend dev server running on http://localhost:5173
✅ **WORKING**: Health endpoint responding at /health
✅ **WORKING**: Static file serving for existing HTML pages
✅ **WORKING**: React development environment active

## Current Application Features
- Main landing page at `/`
- Complete system at `/complete`
- Demo system at `/demo`
- React consultation app at `/consulta`
- Health monitoring at `/health`
- API status at `/api/status`

## Next Steps
The application is now running successfully in development mode. The workflow issue has been resolved with a working development environment that serves both the legacy HTML files and the modern React application.

## Technical Architecture
- **Backend**: Express.js server with TypeScript support
- **Frontend**: React with Vite for development
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **UI**: Radix UI components with Tailwind CSS
- **Development**: Hot reloading enabled for both frontend and backend
